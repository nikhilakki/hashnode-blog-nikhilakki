In Go, backtick tags are used in struct definitions to define metadata, typically for serialization or data validation. These tags are most commonly used with libraries like `encoding/json`, `encoding/xml`, or for other custom use cases. The backtick notation allows you to annotate struct fields with string-based metadata.

Here’s an example:

```go
type Person struct {
    Name  string `json:"name"`
    Age   int    `json:"age"`
    Email string `json:"email,omitempty"`
}
```

### Explanation:

* The backticks enclose the struct field tags.
    
* `json:"name"` tells the JSON encoder/decoder to map the `Name` field to/from the `"name"` key in a JSON object.
    
* `json:"email,omitempty"` means the `Email` field is mapped to the `"email"` key, but will be omitted from the output if it is empty (`""` for strings, `0` for numbers, `nil` for pointers, etc.).
    

Other libraries may use similar mechanisms to interact with struct fields based on these tags.

### Is this Meta-programming?

While Go struct tags resemble metadata, they are not considered full-fledged **metaprogramming** in the traditional sense. Go doesn't support dynamic code generation, reflection-based type alterations, or macros as seen in languages like Python or Lisp. However, Go does offer **reflection** through the `reflect` package, which allows inspecting types and values at runtime, and struct tags play a role in this.

In Go, struct tags are more like static metadata annotations. They're mainly used in tandem with reflection for libraries like `json`, `xml`, or ORM libraries, but they don't alter the behavior of the program at compile time (like traditional metaprogramming might).

### How it works:

* Struct tags are stored as part of the field’s definition and can be accessed at runtime via the `reflect` package. For instance, libraries read these tags to determine how to serialize or deserialize struct fields.
    

Example of accessing tags using reflection:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "reflect"
)

type Person struct {
    Name  string `json:"name"`
    Email string `json:"email,omitempty"`
}

func main() {
    personType := reflect.TypeOf(Person{})
    field, _ := personType.FieldByName("Name")
    fmt.Println(field.Tag.Get("json")) // Output: name
}
```

This allows libraries to interpret and utilize struct tags but without changing the structure or logic of the program dynamically at runtime.

### Conclusion:

This tag system makes it possible to control how data is marshaled and un-marshaled between Go structs and external data formats. While Go struct tags are reflective metadata that can be introspected at runtime, they don't fall under true **metaprogramming** as Go lacks dynamic code modification capabilities. Instead, Go focuses on simplicity and explicitness, using tools like reflection sparingly to provide extensibility.
