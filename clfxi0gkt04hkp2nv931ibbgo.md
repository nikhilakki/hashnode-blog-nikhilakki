Django is a high-level, open-source Python web framework that allows developers to quickly and efficiently build web applications. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and emphasizes the concept of "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) and "convention over configuration" (CoC) to make web development more efficient and less time-consuming.

Django provides a wide range of features, such as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system, automatic administration interface, URL routing, template engine, security features, and more. It also has a vibrant community that provides a wealth of third-party packages and plugins to extend its functionality.

Some notable websites built with [Django include Instagram, Mozilla, Pinterest, and Disqus.](https://icts.io/2020/12/23/8-popular-websites-built-with-django-framework/#:~:text=Here%20is%20a%20list%20of%208%20popular%20websites,7%207.%20Mozilla%20...%208%208.%20Pinterest%20)

Here are some of the **main features of Django**:

1. [**Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1279613/what-is-an-orm-how-does-it-work-and-how-should-i-use-one): Django provides a high-level ORM that allows developers to interact with the database using Python code, rather than writing SQL queries directly. This makes it easier to work with databases and provides an additional layer of abstraction for managing database operations.
    
2. [**Admin interface**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/admin/): Django includes a built-in admin interface that allows developers to manage site content without writing additional code. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing database records, and it can be easily customized to fit specific project requirements.
    
3. [**URL routing**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/http/urls/): Django includes a flexible URL routing system that allows developers to map URLs to views, making it easy to build complex, dynamic web applications.
    
4. [**A template engine**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/templates/): Django's template engine allows developers to create dynamic HTML templates that can be easily customized and reused across the site. It provides a powerful set of tools for working with templates, including template inheritance, filters, and tags.
    
5. [**Security features**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/security/): Django includes several built-in security features, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) protection, cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection, and password management tools.
    
6. [**Internationalization and localization**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/i18n/): Django provides built-in support for internationalization and localization, making it easy to build sites that support multiple languages and regions.
    
7. [**Scalability**](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-scale-django-beyond-the-basics): Django is designed to be scalable and can handle high levels of traffic and large datasets. It can be easily integrated with other technologies such as caching layers, message brokers, and search engines to further improve performance.
    

### A note on the MVC/MVT design pattern

Django follows a variation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which is sometimes referred to as Model-View-Template (MVT). In this pattern, the model represents the data and business logic of the application, the view handles the presentation logic and user interface, and the template is responsible for rendering the HTML that is sent to the user's browser.

However, in Django's version of the pattern, the controller is replaced by a set of URL patterns that map requests to views. The views are responsible for handling requests, performing any necessary business logic, and returning a response to the user. The template then renders the response into HTML for display in the user's browser.

So, in summary, Django follows a variation of the MVC pattern known as MVT, where the controller is replaced by URL patterns and the views handle the business logic.
