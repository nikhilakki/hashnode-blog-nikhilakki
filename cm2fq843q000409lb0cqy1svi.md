A [**greenlet**](https://greenlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a lightweight, low-level coroutine-like primitive in Python, used primarily for concurrency. It is part of the `greenlet` module, which is often associated with **gevent**, a library for asynchronous I/O operations.

Here are some key points about greenlets:

1. **Micro-threading**: Greenlets are like micro-threads that allow you to manage the execution of code blocks without creating actual OS-level threads. They are not parallel, but concurrent, meaning they give the appearance of multitasking by switching between different tasks.
    
2. **Explicit switching**: Unlike Python's built-in coroutines or async/await syntax, greenlets require explicit control over when to switch from one greenlet to another, which is done using the `greenlet.switch()` method.
    
3. **Use Cases**:
    
    * Greenlets are often used in applications that require high concurrency but don't want the overhead of traditional multithreading.
        
    * They are commonly found in networking applications (for example, handling many client connections efficiently) through libraries like **gevent**.
        
4. **Stack Saving**: A greenlet can save the state of the current stack (variables, code location, etc.) and resume from that state later. This allows for cooperative multitasking between greenlets.
    

### Simple Example:

```python
from greenlet import greenlet

def task1():
    print("Task 1 - Part 1")
    g2.switch()  # Switch to task 2
    print("Task 1 - Part 2")

def task2():
    print("Task 2 - Part 1")
    g1.switch()  # Switch back to task 1
    print("Task 2 - Part 2")

g1 = greenlet(task1)
g2 = greenlet(task2)

g1.switch()  # Start execution with task1
```

In this example, `task1` and `task2` switch between each other, creating a form of cooperative concurrency.

### Related Libraries:

* [**gevent**](https://www.gevent.org/): A higher-level library that builds on greenlets and provides more abstract concurrency features like networking and I/O operations.
    

Greenlets are quite powerful but are not used as widely as Python's modern asynchronous capabilities, such as `asyncio`, which provides a higher-level API for concurrency.
