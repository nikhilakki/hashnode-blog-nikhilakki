### **Introduction**

In the intricate realm of software development, authentication and authorization play pivotal roles in securing digital landscapes. As gatekeepers of access, they define who gets in and what they can do once inside. This blog unravels the nuances of these two fundamental concepts.

Authentication is like showing your ID to enter a club, proving who you are. Authorization is the bouncer allowing only certain people to access VIP areas.

This table provides a quick and concise comparison of the key differences between authentication and authorization.

| **Definition** | Verifies user identity. | Determines user permissions. |
| **Common Methods** | Passwords, bio-metrics. | Role-based, rule-based access control. |
| **Relationship** | Authentication precedes authorization. | Authentication establishes identity,while authorization defines permissions. |
| **Focus** | Ensures the right person is at the door. | Decides what rooms (resources) they can enter. |
| **Process** | Involves validation. | Involves permission assignment. |
| **Example** | Your ID card. | The list dictating where you can go in a building. |

### **Use Cases**

1. **User Access Control:** Restricting employee access to sensitive company data.
