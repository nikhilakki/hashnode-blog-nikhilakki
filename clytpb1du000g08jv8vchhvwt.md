Dream is a lightweight, high-performance web framework for OCaml that aims to simplify web development while leveraging the language's strong type system and functional programming paradigm. Developed by Anton Bachin, Dream provides a cohesive set of tools for building web applications, APIs, and microservices. It combines simplicity with power, offering an intuitive API that allows developers to create robust web solutions quickly and efficiently.

Dream stands out for its minimalist approach, focusing on essential features without unnecessary complexity. It provides a solid foundation for web development in OCaml, including routing, request handling, templating, and WebSocket support. The framework's design emphasizes type safety, composability, and performance, making it an attractive choice for developers who value these qualities in their web projects.

### Examples

1. Basic "Hello, World!" server:
    

```ocaml
let () =
  Dream.run
  @@ Dream.logger
  @@ Dream.router [
    Dream.get "/"
      (fun _ -> Dream.html "Hello, World!");
  ]
```

2. Handling route parameters:
    

```ocaml
let greet who =
  Dream.run
  @@ Dream.logger
  @@ Dream.router [
    Dream.get "/hello/:name"
      (fun request ->
        let name = Dream.param request "name" in
        Dream.html (Printf.sprintf "Hello, %s!" name));
  ]
let () = greet ()
```

3. JSON API endpoint:
    

```ocaml
let json_handler _ =
  let data = `Assoc [
    ("message", `String "Hello, JSON!");
    ("timestamp", `Int (int_of_float (Unix.time ())))
  ] in
  Dream.json (Yojson.Safe.to_string data)

let () =
  Dream.run
  @@ Dream.logger
  @@ Dream.router [
    Dream.get "/api/hello" json_handler;
  ]
```

4. WebSocket echo server:
    

```ocaml
let websocket_handler = Dream.websocket (fun ws ->
  let rec loop () =
    match%lwt Dream.receive ws with
    | Some message ->
        let%lwt () = Dream.send ws message in
        loop ()
    | None -> Lwt.return_unit
  in
  loop ())

let () =
  Dream.run
  @@ Dream.logger
  @@ Dream.router [
    Dream.get "/ws" websocket_handler;
  ]
```

### Use cases

1. **RESTful APIs**

* Create chat applications or collaborative tools
    

5. Content Management Systems (CMS)
    

* Develop custom CMS backends
    
* Integrate with databases and handle content delivery
    

### Features

* Lightweight and minimal core
    
* Built-in routing with support for path parameters
    
* Request and response handling with type-safe abstractions
    
* WebSocket support
    
* Static file serving
    
* Sessions and cookies management
    
* HTTPS and HTTP/2 support
    
* Middleware system for easy extensibility
    
* Integration with popular OCaml libraries (Lwt, Yojson, etc.)
    
* Excellent performance and low memory footprint
    
* Comprehensive documentation and examples
    

### Take-away

Dream offers OCaml developers a modern, type-safe, and performant framework for web development. Its minimalist approach and intuitive API make it accessible to both beginners and experienced programmers.
