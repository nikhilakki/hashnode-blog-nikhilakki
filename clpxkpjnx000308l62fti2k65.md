### Intro

In Python, both `classmethod` and `staticmethod` are used to define methods that are bound to a class rather than an instance. However, they serve different purposes.

1. `@classmethod`: This decorator is used to define a method that takes the class itself as its first argument. Conventionally, the first parameter is named `cls`. It can be used to create class-specific methods that have access to the class itself, allowing them to modify class state or create instances of that class.
    
    ```python
    class MyClass:
        class_variable = "class_variable"
    
        @classmethod
        def class_method(cls):
            print(f"Accessing class variable: {cls.class_variable}")
    
    # Call the class method
    MyClass.class_method()
    ```
    
2. `@staticmethod`: This decorator is used to define a method that does not take the class or instance as its first parameter. It behaves like a regular function but is included in a class for organizational purposes. It cannot access or modify class state.
    
    ```python
    class MyClass:
        @staticmethod
        def static_method():
            print("This is a static method")
    
    # Call the static method
    MyClass.static_method()
    ```
    
    ### Summary table
    

| Aspect | @classmethod | @staticmethod |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First Parameter | `cls` (class itself) | None (neither class nor instance) |
| Access to Class State | Yes | No |
| Access to Instance State | No | No |
| Example Usage | Defining methods that modify class | Organizing utility functions within |
|  | state or create instances | a class without access to instance |
|  |  | or class state |

### Takeaway

In summary, use `@classmethod` when you need access to the class itself within the method, and use `@staticmethod` when you don't need access to either the instance or the class.
